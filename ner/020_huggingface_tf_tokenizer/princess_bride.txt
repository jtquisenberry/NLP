FADE IN ON:

A VIDEO GAME ON A COMPUTER SCREEN

The game is in progress. As a sick coughing sound is heard.

                                            CUT TO:

THIS KID

lying in bed, coughing. Pale, one sick cookie. Maybe he's
seven or eight or nine. He holds a remote in one hand,
presses it, and the video game moves a little bit. Then he's
hit by another spasm of coughing, puts the remote down.

His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech.
We're in the present day and this is a middle class house,
somewhere in the suburbs.

                                            CUT TO:

The Kid's MOTHER as she enters, goes to him, fluffs his
pillows, kisses him, and briefly feels his forehead. She's
worried, it doesn't show. During this

                         MOTHER
             You feeling any better?

                         THE KID
             A little bit.

                         MOTHER
             Guess what.

                         THE KID
             What?

                         MOTHER
             Your grandfather's here.

                         THE KID
                  (not overjoyed)
             Mom, can't you tell him that I'm
             sick?

                         MOTHER
             You are sick, that's why he's here.

                         THE KID
             He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.

                         MOTHER
             Maybe he won't.

The Kid shoots her an "I'm sure" look, as we

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S GRANDFATHER bursting into the room. Kind of
rumpled. But the eyes are bright. He has a wrapped package
tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to The Kid,
pinches his cheek.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Hey! How's the sickie? Heh?

The Kid gives his Mother an "I told you so" look. The Mother
ignores it, beats a retreat.

                         MOTHER
             I think I'll leave you two pals.

And she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then...

                         GRANDFATHER
             I brought you a special present.

                         THE KID
             What is it?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Open it up.

The Kid does. He does his best to smile.

                         THE KID
             A book?

                         GRANDFATHER
             That's right. When I was your
             age, television was called books.
             And this is a special book. It
             was the book my father used to
             read to me when I was sick, and I
             used to read it to your father.
             And today, I'm gonna read it to
             you.

                         THE KID
             Has it got any sports in it?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Are you kidding? Fencing. Fighting.
             Torture. Revenge. Giants. Monsters.
             Chases. Escapes. True love.
             Miracles.

THE TWO OF THEM as the Grandfather sits in a chair by the bed.

                         THE KID
                  (manages a shrug)
             It doesn't sound too bad. I'll
             try and stay awake.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. Well, thank you very much.
             It's very nice of you. Your vote
             of confidence is overwhelming.
             All right.

             The Princess Bride, by S.
             Morgenstern. Chapter One.
             Buttercup was raised on a small
             farm in the country of Florin.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The story he's reading about, as the monochromatic look of
the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the English
countryside.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Her favorite pastimes were riding
             her horse and tormenting the farm
             boy that worked there. His name
             was Westley, but she never called
             him that.
                  (to the kid)
             Isn't that a wonderful beginning?

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen doing his best)
             Yeah. It's really good.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Nothing gave Buttercup as much
             pleasure as ordering Westley
             around.
